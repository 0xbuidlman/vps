Hi there,

just doing the first testrun with an initial port of my script for sibcoin. Looks good so far, only a bit here and there left to do.

As far as i understood you asked for the following tasks:
* 1) port of my script for sibcoin
* 2) documentation for the setup and configuration of my script
* 3) Development of a health check script that restarts masternodes if things go wrong

Tasks 1+2 are clear and i can deliver that in the next days. Task 3 could be more detailed in regards what you need exactly. Feel free
to ping me with any more details like "automatic health check every 30 minutes, mail notifications" if you have any. 

I have a first version ready for testing. The script runs on a vultr Ubuntu 16.04 (only this version) VM and does the following:
* installs 1 preconfigured sibcoin masternode (you will only need to provide the masternode key)
* Compilation is currently from source for the desired git repo tag (v0.16.1.1 / stable)
* Some security hardening is done, including firewalling and a separate user
* Automatic startup for all masternode daemons
* It's ipv6 enabled

As i already wrote yesterday, i prefer to receive the amount to be paid in the crypto i am developing for, ideally enough collateral for ONE masternode.

Here is a link for the current (alpha-quality) implementation:

Please give the script above a shot on a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Vultr VM and let me know what's missing. There will definitely be broken things and wrong config at this point and without further testing/review, but the daemon compiles and everything looks good.
I will implement all desired changes after we agreed on the scope and payment.

Best wishes 


Florian
